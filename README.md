## Overview

FedMeNF is a federated meta-learning framework for neural fields that preserves client privacy while enabling fast optimization. Unlike existing approaches where sharing local meta-learners causes privacy leakage, FedMeNF prevents the local meta-learner from converging to the optimal neural field containing private data.
